ðŸ”¹ General Objective:
To design and implement a simple Arduino-based circuit that demonstrates the interaction 
between digital input devices (push buttons) and digital output devices (LEDs), 
in order to understand the basic principles of input/output control, circuit wiring,
and programming using the Arduino platform
